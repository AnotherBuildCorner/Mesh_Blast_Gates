# Mesh_Blast_Gates
## Currently Under Construction

What happens when you combine a Woodworker, and an Electrical Engineer? 
Sometimes the resuls is things like this. A Mesh controlled set of blast gates for dust collection control.

But first, why did I even bother making this? Cost, and Convenience. Products that can do this already exist on the market. However they cost somewhere around $125 USD PER GATE! Plus additional modules to handle higher power collection 230V systems.

On top of that, I already had a fully built system utilizing manual actuated metal blast gates. It really felt like a total waste to rip these gates out in place of some closed solution. And some of the places i wanted to move my existing gates to are inacessible in the course of day to day operation. The commercial option has a switch mounted to the body. Which would impede that solution.

Instead I chose to launch my own system using my pre-existing knowledge of ESP32's and high power hobby servos.

## Notes:

## V3

## V2

## V1
It's safe to consider this a very flawed early prototype. A lot of mistakes were made
